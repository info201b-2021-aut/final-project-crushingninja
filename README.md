Our main objective in this project was to identify general school and player statistics within the NCAA Men's basketball league.

The data we are using for our project was sourced from an Excel spreadsheet containing player statistics from the 2020-2021 season. This file had player information including their school, conference, field goal attempts, field goals made, and other statistics relevant to basketball.

We wanted to consider the distribution of various points made by players of different positions within different conferences. Also, try uncover trends within the ratios of defensive statistics and, hope to unearth the effciency of offense based on the school within their respective conference.
