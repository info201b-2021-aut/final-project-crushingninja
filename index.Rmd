We are interested in finding out how the gap in media regarding ethnic representation, alters the way we perceive society and groups of people within society. We grabbed data regarding different ethnic representation in different forms of media on TV i.e., cable, broadcast, etc. Essentially, we are observing the percentage of screen time for different ethnic groups to see if certain populations are being downplayed or not.

Some pertinent observations we have found from our overall table is that whites have the largest shared percentage of screen time in all forms of TV medias â€“ In total they share 81.2% of screen time among all platforms. In contrary, Native Americans share the least amount of screen time in all forms of TV media, - In total sharing 0.4% of screen time among all platforms. Another notable observation is that out of the entire table, white people had the highest share time out of all medias in cable, with an 88.7%. 

After analyzing our data sets and charts we have discovered major gaps in media representation in both an ethnic and gender standpoint. Through calculations, we have discovered that in total for all share of screens by platform, males had 1.6 times the amount of screen share than females. In every platform; broadcast, cable, and SVOD, the female representation was nearly doubled. When we look at media bias, we notice that white people are favored for all forms of media and have the highest share of screen time. When we see the next highest ethnic representation it's black people. In total for all platforms, white people have roughly 4.5x more screen share than blacks. In terms of which platform has the biggest societal perception, we believe it is broadcast. We have done this by calculating all the minorities from each platform. For broadcast, there is a minority representation of 43.4%. In cable, it is 13%, and finally SVOD has 37.1%.

The purpose of the table with all the data is to specifically look at the gender representation and how it compares overall in different platforms of media. This table also lists out a vast variety of ethnic minorities so it gives a lot of data to look at. So it includes genders, ethnicity, and even orientation. This table plays a part in answering every question but it focuses in on how gender representation in media alters the way we perceive society and the groups of people within society. 

The purpose of the scatter plot is to highlight the ethnicity gap in the total of all shared platforms to illustrate the differences between all ethnic groups. Notable observations include the nearly more than 40% difference between the most screen shared ethnicity, whites, and the least screen shared ethnicity, Native Americans. This chart answers the question of what is the ethnic representation in media in total, and how this gap alters the way we perceive society.

The purpose of the bar graph is to depict how big of a role each ethnic group is now starting to play in different media formats. Unfortunately the data wasn't being represented to scale in the histogram, but the intention of showing growth/progress in ethnic representation is still being depicted. Essentially this bar graph shows media bias and media influence of ethnic groups. A notable observation made from this bar graph is the growth of ethnic representation, and the difference between the highest and lowest as 10%.

The purpose of the staircase chart is to show the difference in representation to scale compared to other groups. This is another useful chart that helps to answer how the gap in ethnic representation in media alters how we perceive groups of people within society. A notable observation that is shown is that there is almost an 80% difference in media representation between the most screen shared group and least screen shared group.
